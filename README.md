# How Fresh
How Fresh is an index of vegetable seasonality in Northern California. More veggies photos and regions coming soon.

This is a side-project photographed, designed and built by O/M, a food-loving product design studio in San Francisco, CA. Vegetable data by CUESA. Actual vegetables by the wonderful grocers and farmers of San Francisco.
